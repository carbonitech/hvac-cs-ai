Borrowing from the OpenAI Cookbook Question/Answering example using embeddings

https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/Question_answering_using_embeddings.ipynb

Full procedure

1. Prepare search data (once)
    A. Collect: We'll download a few hundred Wikipedia articles about the 2022 Olympics
    B.Chunk: Documents are split into short, mostly self-contained sections to be embedded
    C.Embed: Each section is embedded with the OpenAI API
    D.Store: Embeddings are saved (for large datasets, use a vector database)
2. Search (once per query)
    A.Given a user question, generate an embedding for the query from the OpenAI API
    B.Using the embeddings, rank the text sections by relevance to the query
3. Ask (once per query)
    A.Insert the question and the most relevant sections into a message to GPT
    B.Return GPT's answer
